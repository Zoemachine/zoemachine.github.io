                    Your documents and client data will never leave your machine, not for inference, storage, or analytics. There is no cloud endpoint, no API call, no telemetry, no hidden sync. The system is fully air-gapped by design — a closed loop between you, ZOE, and your files. That means absolute confidentiality, zero attack surface, and compliance that SaaS tools simply cannot match. It's the closest thing to a digital vault for your work product and your client's data. The team behind ZOE AI brings decades of experience building and managing high‑confidentiality systems that safeguard everything from sensitive defense‑related information to the customer data of top Fortune 50 companies.

                        <p>
                            Having worked with computers throughout his life, William Wei began his career at San Francisco-based technology consulting firm Alt-Think, where he primarily worked on projects for Microsoft. He later graduated from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, where he also earned his MBA from the Kellogg School of Management.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an attorney, William has quarterbacked dozens of public and middle-market business combinations totaling billions of dollars in mergers and acquisitions. He previously worked as part of a legal team that ranked first in the U.S. by volume in de-SPAC mergers and has served as outside general counsel to companies across transactional, tax, employment, and corporate matters, representing clients ranging from large public companies to high-net-worth individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now combining his dual expertise in technology and law, William is also a machine learning engineer and developer. Recognizing the critical need for secure, reliable AI tools in legal practice, he founded ZOE AI to deliver the precision, confidentiality, and consistency that modern legal work demands—without the security compromises of cloud-based solutions.
